# Learning Scala.
My experiments in scala during the coursera course https://class.coursera.org/progfun-005
and much more.

You can find a lot of useful snippets you can use to you own experiments
plus almost all topics are commented and explained by my prospective. I
sincerely hope that what I've written are not bullshits :-D ( every remarks
are appreciated ).

Feel free to reuse all the code for your own purposes.
